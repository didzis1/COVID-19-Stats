# COVID-19-Stats website

https://c19stats.netlify.app/ is a website I made as a small project towards improving my skills in web development and programming overall.
Website was made only for practice purposes. API can be found in the website's footer or here: https://corona.lmao.ninja/ .

During the making of this project I practiced how to make a website more responsive for smaller devices even though the website is not PERFECT. I also practiced a little bit of jQuery techniques, such as AJAX API requests.
Most difficulties this project involved around the implementation of Chart.js for the statistics of the Corona virus. Some countries with low amount of cases didn't have any historical information in the API so the chart is not showing up for specific countries.
A little bit of practice was involved around Regular Expressions as well.

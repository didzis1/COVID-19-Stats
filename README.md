# COVID-19-Stats website

https://c19stats.netlify.app/ is a website I made as a small project towards improving my skills in web development and programming overall.
Website was made only for practice purposes. API can be found in the website's footer or here: https://corona.lmao.ninja/ .

During the making of this project I practiced how to make a website more responsive for smaller devices even though the website is not PERFECT. I also practiced a little bit of jQuery techniques, such as AJAX API requests.
A little bit of practice was involved around Regular Expressions as well.
